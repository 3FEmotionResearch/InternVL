The question you're asking is about comparing the size of a koala and a snail. \n\nTypically, a koala is much larger than a snail. Koalas are marsupials that can grow up to about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) in length and weigh around 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 pounds). On the other hand, a typical garden snail is much smaller, usually growing to about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length.\n\nSo, if you are comparing the two based on size, a koala is larger than a snail.",

Let's focus on the task at hand: comparing the sizes of a koala and a snail.\n\nA koala is a marsupial native to Australia, while a snail is a small, slow-moving gastropod mollusk. Generally, a koala is much larger than a snail. Koalas can weigh between 4 to 15 kilograms (about 9 to 33 pounds) and are typically about 60 to 85 centimeters (24 to 33 inches) in length.
